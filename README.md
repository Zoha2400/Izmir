Izmir react


I worked on a React project for two weeks focused on a real estate development. Unfortunately, after two weeks, I was unable to meet the deadline, and as a result, the project has been closed today with some incomplete functionality.

Despite my best efforts and dedication, certain challenges and complexities arose during the development process that impeded progress. I am committed to learning from this experience and will use it to improve my project management and problem-solving skills moving forward.
